# Chess Board + Engine
The goal of this project is to create a simple chess client where humans and AIs can compete.

## Structure
The files under `/client` are responsible for the orchestration of the game, communication between scripts and user interface.
The files under `/engine` are implementations of chess engines. AIs meant to play the game.
